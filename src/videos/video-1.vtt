1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.830
the turkish grand prix it's lights out and

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.070
away we go and they are crawling off the

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.270
line especially max verstappen hamilton

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.030
though gets a really good start passes two

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.169
cars already stroll is in the lead going

6
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.230
into turn one ahead of his teammate sergio

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.129
perez hamilton on the inside of daniel

8
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.490
ricciardo as esteban ocon crucially

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.870
valtteri bottas spin out and away onto the

10
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.300
runoff area at turn one that is a

11
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.439
horrendous start for bottas not what he

12
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.689
would have wanted sebastian vettel already

13
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.849
ahead of max verstappen and alex albon in

14
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.860
the thick of it as well

15
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.440
so stroll leads perez and there going wide

16
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.600
is lewis hamilton i was gonna say strongly

17
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.519
's parents leads hamilton but no leads

18
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.800
sebastian vettel what a start from him from

19
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.080
eleventh on the grid now alex albon is

20
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.250
overtaking lewis hamilton as well and

21
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.720
that's verstappen i should say is

22
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279
overtaking lewis hamilton as well here

23
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.900
comes alex albon he might fancy a run at

24
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.860
the mercedes going into the next corner

25
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.830
because he's got hotter tyres hamilton 's

26
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.060
been off the track down the inside goes

27
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.400
alex albon does he take the place hamilton

28
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.459
will try and fight it if he can but he just

29
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.970
hasn't got the grip do so he's skating

30
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.570
around on phillips at the moment as albon

31
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.230
manages to get past the mercedes

32
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.360
it's the run down towards turn seven and

33
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.820
that is how he managed to get past the

34
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.539
ferrari seems that he switched his tyres on

35
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.050
that little bit better than the two around him

36
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.990
max verstappen is also really valid

37
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.840
question why haven't they enabled DRS i'm

38
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.009
not sure they ever enabled DRS when you're

39
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.039
on intermediates and wet ohh look at that

40
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.410
here we go there's a chance for max

41
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.690
verstappen cause sergio perez didn't get

42
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.870
out of that little chicane very well at all

43
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.710
and verstappen it's hot on his tail and

44
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.770
perez keeps ahead by a metre through turn

45
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.520
eleven understanding goes wide and spins as

46
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.830
well he got caught up behind the rear wing

47
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.010
of sergio perez and that has proved very

48
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.890
costly indeed he's avoided the barriers but

49
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.460
his teammate alex albon now cruises past

50
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.259
and goes into third place and verstappen

51
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.380
through the mud back onto the track again

52
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.340
has lost the podium place and also lost

53
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.080
fourth and fifth to vettel and hamilton 's

54
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.080
frustration coming through there for max

55
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.180
stappen that that's

56
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.240
not the smartest thing i've ever seen him

57
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.979
do though

58
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.019
valtteri bottas he's gonna wanna have

59
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.480
guests at least his third spin today isn't

60
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.160
it he is gonna wanna forget this weekend as

61
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.760
quickly as possible

62
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.899
here's lando norris on george russell

63
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.120
eleventh place up for grabs with this move

64
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.660
it always sends one down the inside bounces

65
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.839
off the williams and manages to squeeze

66
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.920
himself up to eleventh

67
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.980
off the road yeah saw that

68
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.900
we're watching carlos sainz

69
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.799
who's gaining on daniel ricciardo at the

70
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.490
moment and ohh daniel ricciardo not having

71
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.120
the best of times through that little

72
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.700
chicane out of turn

73
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.600
ten and eleven carlos sainz ahead of daniel

74
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.540
ricciardo sainz moves himself up into sixth

75
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.660
place and in the end the lack of grip that

76
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.600
the renault was suffering made it a lot

77
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.040
easier for

78
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.190
science that he first thought it might be

79
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.740
cholera canary in the coal mine again is

80
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.560
putting it a lot of people into the pits

81
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.500
for new intermediates four seconds a lap

82
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.100
quicker than everybody else on the new

83
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.080
intermediates and the new interns go on

84
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.120
it's a clean pit stop ohh no now that's the

85
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.329
problem on the right hand side that's what

86
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.720
you didn't need said but he's away again

87
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.920
and that's alex albon who has spun around

88
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.980
talking of costly incidence how costly is

89
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.800
that gonna be for alex albon lewis hamilton

90
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.950
moves into third place

91
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.410
so new set of intermediate tyres go on for

92
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.470
lance stroll good pit stop from the racing

93
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.929
point crew three point two seconds and

94
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.140
he'll be back out into the race

95
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.670
sorted it all out and there's verstappen

96
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.890
coming through on lance stroll so stroll

97
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.190
has pitted there for a second time and is

98
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.510
now behind max verstappen

99
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.840
hamilton by not pitting really catching up

100
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.340
to sergio perez now where this plays into

101
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.859
verstappen 's hands as if we do go to slicks

102
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.860
as if the next transition that wins him

103
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.250
back his pit stop effectively doesn't it he

104
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.160
goes hamilton on sergio perez he's got DRS

105
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.920
hamilton is gonna make a move into turn

106
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.100
twelve lewis hamilton takes the lead of the

107
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.480
turkish grand prix

108
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.390
sebastian vettel ahead of lance stroll

109
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.390
stroll 's gonna keep coming back O and

110
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.510
trying to get this place once more and he

111
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.789
goes wheel to wheel and gets back past

112
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.100
sebastian vettel charles leclerc ahead of

113
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.710
max verstappen waiting to pick up the

114
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.650
scraps strollers falling back behind

115
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.810
charles leclerc the two ferraris now ahead

116
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.620
of the one time race leader

117
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.900
can't see that rain in the distance we'll

118
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.310
see that said show leclerc is now ahead of

119
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.010
sebastian vettel he's got his team mate and

120
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.890
charles leclerc moves up into fourth place

121
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.050
hamilton is now a pit stop clear of max

122
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.090
verstappen pit stop clear rochelle leclerc

123
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.750
now because leclerc has just got passed max

124
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.450
verstappen

125
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.530
thirty nine laps hamiltons have those tyres

126
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.590
on thirty four laps repairs here goes

127
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.690
carlos sainz on alex albon albon thought

128
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.170
about trying to move over to the left

129
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.840
realised that the mclaren was there and he

130
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.510
couldn't and alex albon has conceded fifth

131
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.210
place then

132
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.780
well there's a set of interests that just

133
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.540
aren't working whatsoever as lance stroll

134
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.660
goes off the track lando norris gets past

135
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.800
the man who started on pole moves up into

136
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.120
eighth place in this race you've got a feel

137
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.140
for lance stroll

138
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.729
the world championship record is he called

139
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.170
lewis hamilton wins the turkish grand prix

140
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.010
and is a seven time champion of the world

141
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.969
's delight in the hamilton side of the

142
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.090
garage look at this little battle chaplain

143
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.670
locks up on sergio perez he was trying a

144
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.670
move to get second place in this race perez

145
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.230
comes back at him sebastian vettel comes

146
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.970
back at charles leclerc sergio perez for

147
00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.970
the third time

148
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.340
and his formula one career can see the

149
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.050
chequered flag and takes second place in a

150
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.510
race sergio perez on the podium sebastian

151
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.409
vettel is back on the podium and charles

152
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.390
leclerc who had the podium in his sights

153
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.110
has to settle for fourth

154
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.150
jesus

155
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.490
that's for all the kids out there

156
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.190
who dream the impossible

157
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.270
you can do it too man

158
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.240
i believe in you guys thank you so much

159
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.410
everyone for your support

160
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.750
just take a moment

161
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.290
to think about what this man has achieved

162
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.140
in this sport he is

163
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.200
the greatest of all time

164
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.610
statistically he can share that with

165
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.870
michael schumacher in terms of

166
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.219
championships but he's made his mark on

167
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.930
this sport in such an impressive way
