                <h1>Intro to Formula 1</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Formula One, also called F1 in short, is an international auto racing 
                    sport. F1 is the highest level of single-seat, open-wheel and open-cockpit 
                    professional motor racing contest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Formula One racing is governed and sanctioned by a world body called the 
                    FIA − Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile or the International 
                    Automobile Federation. The name ‘Formula’ comes from the set of rules 
                    that the participating cars and drivers must follow.
                </p>
                <h2>Grand Prix</h2>
                <p> 
                    series of Formula One races are conducted over a period of time, usually 
                    over a year called the ‘Formula One World Championship season’. Each race 
                    in a season is called a ‘Grand Prix’ or GP and all the races in a season 
                    combined are called ‘Grands Prix’ (plural of Grand Prix). The term ‘Grand 
                    Prix’ is derived from French which means ‘great prize’.
                </p>
                <h2>Number of Grand Prix in a Season</h2>
                <p>
                    The number of Grand Prix in a season has varied through the years, starting 
                    from 1950 which had 7 races. This number kept increasing up to a maximum of 
                    20 GPs a year (in 2012). Normally there are 19 to 20 GPs in a season now.
                </p>
                <h2>Grand Prix Naming</h2>
                <p>
                    Each GP in a season is hosted by a different country and are named after the 
                    host country. Example: A GP held in Australia is called an Australian Grand Prix, 
                    that held in Monaco is called the Monaco Grand Prix and so on. However, a GP can 
                    be held in same or different cities of the host country every year.
                </p>
                <h2>Racing Distance</h2>
                <p>
                    The minimum total distance of a Grand Prix race, including all the pre-defined number 
                    of laps must be 300 km or 190 miles. This is the standard distance for all races except 
                    for the Monaco GP which is 260 km or 160 miles.
                </p>

                    2022. That is, a total of 20 cars can enter the competition. However, the FIA regulations 
                    allow a limit of 26 cars for the championship.
